# Poe Utils
Path Of Exile AHK Util Macros

All the functions will work without any changes for Windowed FullScreen 1920x1080, having wisdom & portal scrolls respectively on the last 2 positions of the first row. 

The SwichGem function will work only if you have the same setup like me (see details in the function). 
Most probably you will need to adjust the positions as this is mostly character based.

For different setups (resolution and/or scroll positions in inventory) you need to use the CheckPos function and change the coordonates in each of the respective functions.
